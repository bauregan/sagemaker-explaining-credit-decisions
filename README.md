# Explaining Credit Decisions with Amazon SageMaker

Given the increasing complexity of machine learning models, the need for model explainability has been growing lately. Some governments have also introduced stricter regulations that mandate a *right to explanation* from machine learning models. In this solution, we take a look at how [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) can be used to explain individual predictions from machine learning models.

As an example application, we classify credit applications and predict whether the credit would be paid back or not (often called a *credit default*). More context can be found [here](#why-is-credit-default-prediction-useful-and-how-does-explainability-help). We train a tree-based [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) model using [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) and explain its predictions using a game theoretic approach called [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

Ultimately, we deploy an endpoint that returns the model prediction and the associated explanation.

**What is an explanation?**

Given a set of input features used to describe a credit application (e.g. `credit__amount` and `employment__duration`), an explanation reflects the contribution of each feature to the model's final prediction. We include a number of visualizations that can be used to see how each feature pushes up or down the risk of credit default for an individual application.

## Requirements

You will need an AWS account to use this solution. Sign up for an account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).

You will also need to have permission to use [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) and to create all the resources detailed in the [architecture section](#architecture). All AWS permissions can be managed through [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/). Admin users will have the required permissions, but please contact your account's AWS administrator if your user account doesn't have the required permissions.

## Getting Started

Click on one of the following buttons to *quick create* the AWS CloudFormation Stack:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="3">AWS Region</td>
    <th>AWS CloudFormation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>US West</td>
    <td>Oregon</td>
    <td>us-west-2</td>
    <td align="center">
      <a href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://sagemaker-solutions-us-west-2.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Explaining-credit-decisions/build/packaged.yaml&stackName=explaining-credit-decisions">
        <img src="docs/launch_button.svg" height="30">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

You should acknowledge the use of the two capabilities and click 'Create Stack'. Once stack creation has completed successfully, click the 'SageMakerNotebookInstanceSignOn' link on the 'Outputs' tab. Click 'notebook.ipynb' and follow the instruction inside the notebook.

**Caution**: Cloning this GitHub repository and running the code manually could lead to unexpected issues! Use the AWS CloudFormation template. You'll get an Amazon SageMaker Notebook instance that's been correctly setup and configured to access the other resources in the solution.

## Costs

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this solution.

As of 6th April 2020 in the US West (Oregon) region, the cost to:

* prepare the dataset with AWS Glue is ~$0.75.
* train the model using Amazon SageMaker training job on ml.c5.xlarge is ~$0.02.
* host the model using Amazon SageMaker Endpoint on ml.c5.xlarge is $0.119 per hour.

## Cleaning Up

When you've finished with this solution, make sure that you delete all
unwanted AWS resources. AWS CloudFormation can be used to automatically delete
all standard resources that have been created by the solution and notebook.
Go to the AWS CloudFormation Console, and delete the *parent* stack.
Choosing to delete the parent stack will automatically delete the nested stacks.

**Caution**: You need to manually delete any extra resources that you may have
created in this notebook. Some examples include, extra Amazon S3 buckets (to
the solution's default bucket), extra Amazon SageMaker endpoints (using a
custom name), and extra Amazon ECR repositories.

## FAQ

### What is explainability?

Model explainability is the degree to which humans can understand the cause of decisions made by a machine learning model. Many methods now exist for formulating explanations from complex models that are interpretable and faithful.

### Why is explainability useful?

An explanation gives stakeholders a way to understand the relationships and patterns learned by a machine learning model. As an example, an explanation can be used to verify that meaningful relationships are being used by the model instead of spurious relationships. Such checks can give stakeholders more confidence in the reliability and robustness of the model for real-world deployments. It’s critical for building trust in the system. When issues are found, explanations often give scientists a strong indication of what needs to be fixed in the dataset or model training procedure: saving significant time and money. Other serious issues, such a social discrimination and bias, can be clearly flagged by an explanation.

### Why is credit default prediction useful? And how does explainability help?

Given a credit application from a bank customer, the aim of the bank is to predict whether or not the customer will pay back the credit in accordance with their repayment plan. When a customer can't pay back their credit, often called a 'default', the bank loses money and the customer's credit score will be impacted. On the other hand, denying trustworthy customers credit also has a set of negative impacts.

Using accurate machine learning models to classify the risk of a credit application can help find a good balance between these two scenarios, but this provides no comfort to those customers who have been denied credit. Using explainability methods, it's possible to determine actionable factors that had a negative impact on the application. Customers can then take action to increase their chance of obtaining credit in subsequent applications.

### What is SHAP?

[SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) (Lundberg et al. 2017) stands for SHapley Additive exPlanations. 'Shapley' relates to a game theoretic concept called [Shapley values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value) that is used to create the explanations. A Shapley value describes the marginal contribution of each 'player' when considering all possible 'coalitions'. Using this in a machine learning context, a Shapley value  describes the marginal contribution of each feature when considering all possible sets of features. 'Additive' relates to the fact that these Shapley values can be summed together to give the final model prediction.

As an example, we might start off with a baseline credit default risk of 10%. Given a set of features, we can calculate the Shapley value for each feature. Summing together all the Shapley values, we might obtain a cumulative value of +30%. Given the same set of features, we therefore expect our model to return a credit default risk of 40% (i.e. 10% + 30%).

## Credits

Our datasets (i.e. credits, people and contacts) were synthetically created from features contained in the [German Credit Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog%2B%28german%2Bcredit%2Bdata%29) (UCI Machine Learning Repository). All personal information was generated using [`Faker`](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
